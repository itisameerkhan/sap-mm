‚≠ê **types of procurement** 

* internal 

* external 

---

 **1Ô∏è‚É£ External Procurement**

**External Procurement** involves acquiring goods or services from external vendors or suppliers outside the organization. This is the most common method of procurement and includes the process of sourcing, purchasing, and receiving materials from external sources.

**Key Points in External Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The materials are obtained from third-party vendors or suppliers.
- **Stock Procurement**: The goods are bought and stored in the company's inventory.
- **Consumption-Based Procurement**: The goods are consumed immediately or used directly in production.
- **Subcontracting**: Semi-finished goods are sent to an external supplier for processing, and the finished goods are returned.
- **Third-Party Procurement**: Goods are directly delivered from a vendor to the customer, bypassing the company‚Äôs inventory.

---

 **2Ô∏è‚É£ Internal Procurement**

**Internal Procurement** involves moving goods or materials from one plant, warehouse, or storage location to another within the same organization. This is commonly referred to as **Stock Transfer** or **Inter-Plant Transfer**.

 **Key Points in Internal Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The goods are obtained from the organization's own plants or storage locations, not external suppliers.
- **Stock Transfer**: Material is moved from one location to another within the organization.
- **No Purchase Order**: Since the transaction happens within the same organization, there is no need for a formal purchase order.
- **No Vendor Involvement**: No external vendor is involved in the process.

 **Key Differences Between Internal and External Procurement:**

| Aspect                          | **External Procurement**                                       | **Internal Procurement**                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source of Supply**             | External vendors/suppliers                                   | Internal plants or storage locations                          |
| **Transaction Involvement**      | Involves a purchase order (PO), vendor, and payment process. | Involves stock transfer between locations, no vendor.          |
| **Materials Movement**           | Materials are received from external suppliers into stock.   | Materials are moved between different plants or storage locations. |
| **Procurement Process**          | Full procurement process (PO, GR, Invoice, Payment).         | Simple stock transfer or consignment process.                 |
| **Example**                      | Buying raw materials or finished goods from an external supplier. | Transferring finished goods from one warehouse to another.    |

---

 **Use Cases:**

 **External Procurement**:
- Used when the organization needs materials or services from outside suppliers, such as raw materials, finished goods, or services like consulting.
  
 **Internal Procurement**:
- Used for internal transfers, where materials need to be moved from one location or plant to another within the same organization (e.g., moving raw materials from warehouse A to production plant B).

### methods for procurements 

1. procurement for stock

2. procurement for direct consumption 

**procurement for stock** 

* Stock Procurement involves purchasing materials from external vendors and storing them in the company‚Äôs inventory or stock. This method is used when the organization wants to maintain control over the materials in stock and keep them available for future use.

key components

* goods receipt

* stock management 
* purchasing order 
* invoice verification 

material must have material master 

**procurement for direct consumoption**

Direct Consumption Procurement (also known as Consumption-Based Procurement) involves purchasing materials or services directly for immediate use or consumption, rather than storing them in inventory. In this method, goods are procured, but they are not stocked‚Äîthey are directly consumed by production or other operations.

* goods receipt 

* no stock update 

* no stock management 

material may have master 

* one time purchase order

* longer terms contract 

* longer terms scheduling agreement

### ‚ö° **RENCONCILIATION**

What is a Reconciliation Account?
A Reconciliation Account in SAP is a General Ledger (G/L) account that connects sub-ledgers (e.g., Vendor Accounts in Accounts Payable) to the main ledger (General Ledger - FI module).

üîπ It ensures that all vendor transactions (purchases, invoices, payments) are automatically posted to the correct G/L accounts in Financial Accounting (FI).

üîπ Vendors do not post directly to G/L accounts; instead, they post to vendor sub-ledgers, which in turn update the reconciliation account in FI.

* ‚úÖ Ensures real-time financial integration between MM & FI.

* ‚úÖ Helps in automatic financial posting for vendor transactions.
* ‚úÖ Eliminates the need for manual entries in the General Ledger.
* ‚úÖ Maintains data consistency across FI and MM modules.

### ‚ö° PARTNER ROLES 

In SAP MM (Materials Management), Partner Roles are used to define the different roles that an entity (like a vendor or customer) plays in a business process. These roles help determine the relationship between the business partner (e.g., vendor, customer) and the company in various transactions.

| **Partner Role**       | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VN (Vendor)**         | The main partner in procurement; the entity supplying the goods/services.      |
| **WE (Goods Supplier)** | The partner who delivers goods (could be different from the vendor in some cases). |
| **RE (Payee)**          | The partner receiving payments (often the vendor or an agent).                |
| **OA (Ordering Address)**| The partner who receives the order (can be the vendor or a specific department). |
| **IV (Invoice Address)** | The partner who receives invoices related to the transaction.                |
| **GR (Goods Receipt)**  | The partner associated with goods receipt (not always used in every business scenario). |

**CONFIGURATION OF VENDOR MASTER**

* account groups for vendors 

* field selection 
* number assignment 
* levels for vendor data 
* partner roles 

 **1. Different Organization Levels of Vendor Master**

The **Vendor Master** in SAP MM is structured into different levels based on the scope and relevance of the data. The organization levels define where the data will be applicable, ranging from a global level (valid for all company codes) to more specific levels.

The main **organization levels** for vendor master records are:

- **Client Level**: Data at the client level is global and applicable across all company codes. Information such as the **vendor's name** and **address** is maintained at this level.
- **Company Code Level**: Data specific to each company code is maintained at this level. It includes the **vendor‚Äôs bank details**, **payment terms**, and **reconciliation accounts**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Data at this level is relevant to procurement activities and includes **partner functions** like **ordering address**, **invoice address**, and **payment terms**.

---

 **2. Significance of Account Group**

The **Account Group** in the vendor master is a crucial element in SAP MM, and its significance lies in:

- **Defining the Number Range**: The account group determines the **number range** for vendor accounts, allowing automatic assignment of vendor account numbers (either internal or external).
- **Controlling Fields**: The account group controls which fields are required, optional, or suppressed when creating or maintaining a vendor master record. Different account groups allow for different sets of required fields based on business needs.
- **Determining Vendor Type**: It helps in categorizing vendors into groups like **external vendors**, **one-time vendors**, and **internal vendors**. The account group helps configure the behavior of the vendor in terms of financial and procurement processes.

---

 **3. Functionality of Partner Functions**

In SAP MM, **Partner Functions** define the different roles a business partner (like a vendor) can play in a transaction. The main functionality of partner functions includes:

- **Role Assignment**: Each partner (vendor) can be assigned multiple roles like **Ordering Address**, **Invoice Address**, **Payee**, **Goods Supplier**, etc. This ensures that the correct party is associated with each part of the process.
- **Transaction Control**: Partner functions control how transactions are handled, such as whether a vendor is used for ordering goods or receiving payments.
- **Flexibility**: They enable flexibility by allowing different partners to handle different parts of the business process (e.g., one partner can be the supplier, another the invoice address).
  
For example, in a **purchase order (PO)**, the **vendor** plays the role of the **ordering address**, but the **invoice address** could be a different entity, allowing separation of responsibilities.

---
 **4. Reconciliation Account and Uses**

A **Reconciliation Account** is a **general ledger (G/L) account** used to aggregate subledger balances from specific vendors. It ensures that transactions are properly reflected in the general ledger for **accounting purposes**.

#### **Uses of Reconciliation Account**:
- **Automatic Posting**: When vendor transactions (like invoices or payments) are posted in the system, the reconciliation account is automatically updated, making financial reporting and analysis easier.
- **Financial Integration**: It links **Material Management (MM)** to **Financial Accounting (FI)**, ensuring that vendor transactions are reflected correctly in the financial statements.
- **Tracking Vendor Balances**: It provides a summary view of all transactions for a vendor in the financial accounts, and it prevents manual updates to the G/L, which reduces errors.

For example, when a vendor‚Äôs invoice is posted, the **vendor sub-ledger account** is updated, and the **reconciliation account** in the G/L is also updated automatically.

---

 **5. Different Levels of Vendor Master**

There are **three main levels** in the vendor master record:

- **Client Level**: This level holds **general information** about the vendor such as name, address, and communication data. This data is applicable across all company codes and purchasing organizations.
- **Company Code Level**: Information specific to the company code is maintained at this level, including **payment terms**, **bank details**, and **tax information**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Information relevant to procurement activities is maintained at this level, including **partner functions**, **order data**, and **payment terms** specific to purchasing.

---

**6. Is it Possible to Create Both Internal and External Number Ranges for the Same Vendor Account Group?**

Yes, it is possible to configure both **internal and external number ranges** for the **same vendor account group** in SAP. 

- **Internal Number Range**: SAP automatically assigns numbers to vendor accounts when a vendor is created.
- **External Number Range**: The user manually assigns a number to the vendor when creating the vendor master record.

To create both number ranges for the same account group:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `SPRO` ‚Üí **IMG** ‚Üí **Financial Accounting (FI)** ‚Üí **Accounts Payable** ‚Üí **Vendor Accounts** ‚Üí **Define Account Group and Number Range**.
2. Configure **number ranges** for each account group, specifying whether they are **internal** or **external**.

This allows flexibility in managing different types of vendors, especially when dealing with **one-time vendors** or **local/foreign vendors**.

 **7. How to Block a Vendor in SAP MM**

Vendors can be blocked at the **vendor master** level to prevent any procurement or payment activities. There are two main types of blocks:

1. **Purchasing Block**: Prevents the vendor from being used in procurement transactions.
2. **Payment Block**: Prevents payments from being made to the vendor.

 **Steps to Block a Vendor**:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `XK02` (Change Vendor) or `MK02` (Change Vendor for Purchasing Organization).
2. Enter the **Vendor Number** and **Company Code**.
3. Navigate to the **Payment Transactions** or **Purchasing Data** tab.
4. Under the **Status** section, set the appropriate block (e.g., **Purchasing Block**, **Payment Block**).
5. **Save** the changes to block the vendor.

By blocking a vendor, you ensure that no further transactions are processed for that vendor until the block is removed.

## ‚≠ê PURCHASE INFO RECORD 


*  Material Master and Vendor Master Record are used to store material specific information and vendor specific details, respectively.

* Whereas purchasing info record contains information about a specific material and a vendor supplying the
material.
* It can be maintained at purchasing organization level or plant specific, as per the business requirements.
*  The ‚ÄúPurchasing Info record‚Äù is used to store the combination a Material and Vendor with the pricing details for
the specific period of time, planned delivery time
* It serves as a source of information for Purchasing.
