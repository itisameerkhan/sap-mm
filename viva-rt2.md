‚≠ê **types of procurement** 

* internal 

* external 

---

 **1Ô∏è‚É£ External Procurement**

**External Procurement** involves acquiring goods or services from external vendors or suppliers outside the organization. This is the most common method of procurement and includes the process of sourcing, purchasing, and receiving materials from external sources.

**Key Points in External Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The materials are obtained from third-party vendors or suppliers.
- **Stock Procurement**: The goods are bought and stored in the company's inventory.
- **Consumption-Based Procurement**: The goods are consumed immediately or used directly in production.
- **Subcontracting**: Semi-finished goods are sent to an external supplier for processing, and the finished goods are returned.
- **Third-Party Procurement**: Goods are directly delivered from a vendor to the customer, bypassing the company‚Äôs inventory.

---

 **2Ô∏è‚É£ Internal Procurement**

**Internal Procurement** involves moving goods or materials from one plant, warehouse, or storage location to another within the same organization. This is commonly referred to as **Stock Transfer** or **Inter-Plant Transfer**.

 **Key Points in Internal Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The goods are obtained from the organization's own plants or storage locations, not external suppliers.
- **Stock Transfer**: Material is moved from one location to another within the organization.
- **No Purchase Order**: Since the transaction happens within the same organization, there is no need for a formal purchase order.
- **No Vendor Involvement**: No external vendor is involved in the process.

 **Key Differences Between Internal and External Procurement:**

| Aspect                          | **External Procurement**                                       | **Internal Procurement**                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source of Supply**             | External vendors/suppliers                                   | Internal plants or storage locations                          |
| **Transaction Involvement**      | Involves a purchase order (PO), vendor, and payment process. | Involves stock transfer between locations, no vendor.          |
| **Materials Movement**           | Materials are received from external suppliers into stock.   | Materials are moved between different plants or storage locations. |
| **Procurement Process**          | Full procurement process (PO, GR, Invoice, Payment).         | Simple stock transfer or consignment process.                 |
| **Example**                      | Buying raw materials or finished goods from an external supplier. | Transferring finished goods from one warehouse to another.    |

---

 **Use Cases:**

 **External Procurement**:
- Used when the organization needs materials or services from outside suppliers, such as raw materials, finished goods, or services like consulting.
  
 **Internal Procurement**:
- Used for internal transfers, where materials need to be moved from one location or plant to another within the same organization (e.g., moving raw materials from warehouse A to production plant B).

### methods for procurements 

1. procurement for stock

2. procurement for direct consumption 

**procurement for stock** 

* Stock Procurement involves purchasing materials from external vendors and storing them in the company‚Äôs inventory or stock. This method is used when the organization wants to maintain control over the materials in stock and keep them available for future use.

key components

* goods receipt

* stock management 
* purchasing order 
* invoice verification 

material must have material master 

**procurement for direct consumoption**

In this method, goods are procured, but they are not stocked‚Äîthey are directly consumed by production or other operations.

* goods receipt 

* no stock update 

* no stock management 

material may have master 

* one time purchase order

* longer terms contract 

* longer terms scheduling agreement

### ‚ö° **RENCONCILIATION**

What is a Reconciliation Account?
A Reconciliation Account in SAP is a General Ledger (G/L) account that connects sub-ledgers (e.g., Vendor Accounts in Accounts Payable) to the main ledger (General Ledger - FI module).

üîπ It ensures that all vendor transactions (purchases, invoices, payments) are automatically posted to the correct G/L accounts in Financial Accounting (FI).

üîπ Vendors do not post directly to G/L accounts; instead, they post to vendor sub-ledgers, which in turn update the reconciliation account in FI.

* ‚úÖ Ensures real-time financial integration between MM & FI.

* ‚úÖ Helps in automatic financial posting for vendor transactions.
* ‚úÖ Eliminates the need for manual entries in the General Ledger.

### ‚ö° PARTNER ROLES 

In SAP MM (Materials Management), Partner Roles are used to define the different roles that an entity (like a vendor or customer) plays in a business process. These roles help determine the relationship between the business partner (e.g., vendor, customer) and the company in various transactions.

| **Partner Role**       | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VN (Vendor)**         | The main partner in procurement; the entity supplying the goods/services.      |
| **WE (Goods Supplier)** | The partner who delivers goods (could be different from the vendor in some cases). |
| **RE (Payee)**          | The partner receiving payments (often the vendor or an agent).                |
| **OA (Ordering Address)**| The partner who receives the order (can be the vendor or a specific department). |
| **IV (Invoice Address)** | The partner who receives invoices related to the transaction.                |
| **GR (Goods Receipt)**  | The partner associated with goods receipt (not always used in every business scenario). |

**CONFIGURATION OF VENDOR MASTER**

* account groups for vendors 

* field selection 
* number assignment 
* levels for vendor data 
* partner roles 

 **1. Different Organization Levels of Vendor Master**

The **Vendor Master** in SAP MM is structured into different levels based on the scope and relevance of the data. The organization levels define where the data will be applicable, ranging from a global level (valid for all company codes) to more specific levels.

The main **organization levels** for vendor master records are:

- **Client Level**: Data at the client level is global and applicable across all company codes. Information such as the **vendor's name** and **address** is maintained at this level.
- **Company Code Level**: Data specific to each company code is maintained at this level. It includes the **vendor‚Äôs bank details**, **payment terms**, and **reconciliation accounts**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Data at this level is relevant to procurement activities and includes **partner functions** like **ordering address**, **invoice address**, and **payment terms**.

---

 **2. Significance of Account Group**

The **Account Group** in the vendor master is a crucial element in SAP MM, and its significance lies in:

- **Defining the Number Range**: The account group determines the **number range** for vendor accounts, allowing automatic assignment of vendor account numbers (either internal or external).
- **Controlling Fields**: The account group controls which fields are required, optional, or suppressed when creating or maintaining a vendor master record. Different account groups allow for different sets of required fields based on business needs.
- **Determining Vendor Type**: It helps in categorizing vendors into groups like **external vendors**, **one-time vendors**, and **internal vendors**. The account group helps configure the behavior of the vendor in terms of financial and procurement processes.

---

 **3. Functionality of Partner Functions**

In SAP MM, **Partner Functions** define the different roles a business partner (like a vendor) can play in a transaction. The main functionality of partner functions includes:

- **Role Assignment**: Each partner (vendor) can be assigned multiple roles like **Ordering Address**, **Invoice Address**, **Payee**, **Goods Supplier**, etc. This ensures that the correct party is associated with each part of the process.
- **Transaction Control**: Partner functions control how transactions are handled, such as whether a vendor is used for ordering goods or receiving payments.
- **Flexibility**: They enable flexibility by allowing different partners to handle different parts of the business process (e.g., one partner can be the supplier, another the invoice address).
  
For example, in a **purchase order (PO)**, the **vendor** plays the role of the **ordering address**, but the **invoice address** could be a different entity, allowing separation of responsibilities.

---
 **4. Reconciliation Account and Uses**

A **Reconciliation Account** is a **general ledger (G/L) account** used to aggregate subledger balances from specific vendors. It ensures that transactions are properly reflected in the general ledger for **accounting purposes**.

#### **Uses of Reconciliation Account**:
- **Automatic Posting**: When vendor transactions (like invoices or payments) are posted in the system, the reconciliation account is automatically updated, making financial reporting and analysis easier.
- **Financial Integration**: It links **Material Management (MM)** to **Financial Accounting (FI)**, ensuring that vendor transactions are reflected correctly in the financial statements.
- **Tracking Vendor Balances**: It provides a summary view of all transactions for a vendor in the financial accounts, and it prevents manual updates to the G/L, which reduces errors.

For example, when a vendor‚Äôs invoice is posted, the **vendor sub-ledger account** is updated, and the **reconciliation account** in the G/L is also updated automatically.

---

 **5. Different Levels of Vendor Master**

There are **three main levels** in the vendor master record:

- **Client Level**: This level holds **general information** about the vendor such as name, address, and communication data. This data is applicable across all company codes and purchasing organizations.
- **Company Code Level**: Information specific to the company code is maintained at this level, including **payment terms**, **bank details**, and **tax information**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Information relevant to procurement activities is maintained at this level, including **partner functions**, **order data**, and **payment terms** specific to purchasing.

---

**6. Is it Possible to Create Both Internal and External Number Ranges for the Same Vendor Account Group?**

Yes, it is possible to configure both **internal and external number ranges** for the **same vendor account group** in SAP. 

- **Internal Number Range**: SAP automatically assigns numbers to vendor accounts when a vendor is created.
- **External Number Range**: The user manually assigns a number to the vendor when creating the vendor master record.

To create both number ranges for the same account group:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `SPRO` ‚Üí **IMG** ‚Üí **Financial Accounting (FI)** ‚Üí **Accounts Payable** ‚Üí **Vendor Accounts** ‚Üí **Define Account Group and Number Range**.
2. Configure **number ranges** for each account group, specifying whether they are **internal** or **external**.

This allows flexibility in managing different types of vendors, especially when dealing with **one-time vendors** or **local/foreign vendors**.

---

 **7. How to Block a Vendor in SAP MM**

Vendors can be blocked at the **vendor master** level to prevent any procurement or payment activities. There are two main types of blocks:

1. **Purchasing Block**: Prevents the vendor from being used in procurement transactions.
2. **Payment Block**: Prevents payments from being made to the vendor.

 **Steps to Block a Vendor**:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `XK02` (Change Vendor) or `MK02` (Change Vendor for Purchasing Organization).
2. Enter the **Vendor Number** and **Company Code**.
3. Navigate to the **Payment Transactions** or **Purchasing Data** tab.
4. Under the **Status** section, set the appropriate block (e.g., **Purchasing Block**, **Payment Block**).
5. **Save** the changes to block the vendor.

By blocking a vendor, you ensure that no further transactions are processed for that vendor until the block is removed.

## ‚≠ê PURCHASE INFO RECORD 


*  Material Master and Vendor Master Record are used to store material specific information and vendor specific details, respectively.

* Whereas purchasing info record contains information about a specific material and a vendor supplying the
material.
* It can be maintained at purchasing organization level or plant specific, as per the business requirements.
*  The ‚ÄúPurchasing Info record‚Äù is used to store the combination a Material and Vendor with the pricing details for
the specific period of time, planned delivery time

## ‚≠ê SOURCE LIST 

* for some of the materials, there is more than one
source of supply. You can manage these supply sources
using source lists to control how the application-related
supply sources are used.

* Source list specifies the possible sources of supply for a
Material over a given period of time. It shows the time
period in which a material may be ordered from a given
vendor or under a certain long-term purchase
agreement.

* In the source list, you specify which source of supply is
valid for a certain period of time.

* You can specify a preferred source as fixed or MRP-
relevant for a certain period in the source list.

* You can mark an undesired source as blocked.

1. Streamlined Vendor Selection

2. Automatic Vendor Assignment
3. Prevention of Expired Vendor Contracts
4. Integration with MRP (Material Requirements Planning)
5. Fixed Vendor Assignment
6. Cost Control & Transparency


-------

1. What is use of source list?


The Source List in SAP MM is used to manage and control the vendors authorized to supply a material for a specific plant. It ensures compliance by allowing procurement only from approved sources, automates vendor selection during Purchase Requisition (PR) and Purchase Order (PO) creation, and integrates with Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to select vendors automatically. Additionally, it helps assign Fixed Vendors, restrict unauthorized purchasing, and prevent expired vendor contracts from being used.

2. Is it possible to maintain multiple sources for a plant within same validity period?

Yes, it is possible to maintain multiple vendors for a material at the same plant within the same validity period. SAP allows multiple vendors with defined priority rankings, and one vendor can be marked as Fixed, meaning all procurement should be directed to them. If no vendor is fixed, SAP will consider all eligible vendors during procurement.



3. What are different ways of creation of source list?

The source list can be created in different ways. Manually, it can be created using T-Code ME01 by entering vendor and material details. Automatically, it can be generated using T-Code ME05, which derives data from existing Purchasing Info Records (PIRs) and contracts. Additionally, source lists can be created via PIR integration or during an MRP run, where SAP selects vendors based on pre-defined procurement rules.

## ‚≠ê QUOTA ARANGEMENT 


Quota Arrangement is a mechanism in SAP MM that helps distribute procurement requirements among multiple vendors based on predefined percentages. It ensures that a company sources materials from different suppliers in a structured and controlled manner.

**KEY FEATURES**

**Key Features of Quota Arrangement**  
1. **Vendor Allocation** ‚Äì Assigns a specific percentage of procurement to each vendor.  
2. **Automatic Vendor Selection** ‚Äì When creating a Purchase Requisition (PR) or Purchase Order (PO), SAP selects the vendor automatically based on quota percentages.  
3. **Quota Splitting** ‚Äì If multiple vendors exist, SAP distributes the total procurement requirement based on the quota percentage.  
4. **Quota Arrangement Usage Period** ‚Äì Defined start and end dates to control the validity of quota allocation.  
5. **Quota Calculation** ‚Äì Based on past procurement quantities and assigned quota percentages.  


**quota arrangement is tool for source administrration**

![demo](./photos/17.png)

* quota with the lowest quota rating represents the valid source 

### ‚ö° QUOTA RATING 

Quota Rating is a calculated value that helps to determine which vendor will be selected first when there are multiple vendors assigned to the same material in the Quota Arrangement. **The vendor with the lowest quota rating will be selected first for fulfilling procurement requirements.**

## ‚≠ê MATERIAL TYPE 

It defines how materials are managed, procured, and processed within the system. Each material type has specific attributes, controls, and functionalities associated with it, such as procurement method, valuation class, and inventory management.

### ‚ö° Document Type in Purchase Order (PO) in SAP MM

In SAP MM, a Document Type in a Purchase Order (PO) defines the purpose, control parameters, and number range for different types of purchase orders. It helps in classifying and managing procurement documents effectively.

**Key Functions of PO Document Types:**

* Controls Number Range: 

* Determines Field Selection: 

* Manages Workflow & Approvals:

## ‚≠ê ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT 

 **What is Account Assignment in SAP MM?**  
**Account Assignment** in SAP MM is the process of linking a **Purchase Order (PO), Purchase Requisition (PR), or Goods Receipt (GR)** to a **specific cost object** such as a cost center, project, asset, or sales order. It determines how the cost of the purchased material or service is allocated in financial accounting.  

---

 **Why is Account Assignment Required?**  
- It is required when purchasing **non-stock materials or services**, which are not stored in inventory but consumed directly.  
- It ensures proper tracking of expenses and cost allocation in **FI (Financial Accounting) and CO (Controlling) modules**.  

---

**Types of Account Assignment Categories in SAP MM:**  

| **Account Assignment Category** | **Description** | **Example Usage** |
|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **K (Cost Center)** | Costs are charged to a **Cost Center**. | Office supplies, stationary, utilities. |
| **F (Order)** | Costs are assigned to an **Internal Order**. | Temporary projects, events. |
| **P (Project/WBS Element)** | Costs are assigned to a **Project (WBS Element)**. | Construction, IT projects. |
| **A (Asset)** | Costs are booked to an **Asset** in Asset Accounting. | Machinery, vehicles. |
| **C (Sales Order)** | Costs are linked to a **Sales Order** in SD. | Customer-specific purchases. |
| **M (Material)** | Costs are charged to **Material** stock. | Inventory procurement. |
| **Q (Project Stock)** | Costs are booked to **Project Stock**. | Raw materials for specific projects. |
| **U (Unknown)** | Used when account assignment is **not yet determined**. | Temporary usage. |

 **Where is Account Assignment Used?**  
- **Purchase Requisition (PR)**
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Service Entry Sheets (SES)**
- **Goods Receipts (GR)**
- **Invoice Verification (MIRO)**  





* **When GR is done for the PO item, stock will not increase in the system, but it will be directly consumed against the cost object.**

## ‚≠ê CONDITIONS 

![demo](./photos/22.png)

Conditions used to represents pricing elements like price, discounts, subcharges, taxes, delivery costs

Conditions can be maintained while creating quotations, info record, outline agreement, po

* PB00, PBXX - gross price 

* RA01 - discount 
* FRA1 - freight 


* Gross price ‚Üí price without any discounts, surcharges in account 

* Net price ‚Üí price taking after discounts and surcharges

* Effective price ‚Üí net price after deduction of cash discount 


**1. Time-Independent Conditions**

These conditions don‚Äôt change based on time. The price or discount is fixed, no matter when you make the purchase.

**2. Time-Dependent Conditions**

These conditions change depending on the time, such as special offers or discounts available only for certain periods.

## ‚≠ê OUTLINE AGREEMENT 

Outline agreement 
Outline agreement is a long term agreement with the vendor regarding the procurement of material or services 
Types 

Contract agreement 

Scheduling agreement 

Long term agreement between the purchase organization and vendor for procurement of material or service 

In **SAP MM (Materials Management)**, an **Outline Agreement** is a long-term purchasing arrangement between a company and a vendor. It is used to streamline procurement by pre-defining terms and conditions for future transactions. There are two main types of outline agreements in SAP MM:

 **1. Contract (T-Code: ME31K)**
   - A **contract** is a formal agreement with a vendor that specifies the terms of procurement but does not contain detailed delivery schedules.
   - It defines **quantity-based** or **value-based** agreements.
   - The actual procurement is done using **release orders (Purchase Orders, T-Code: ME21N)** referencing the contract.
   - **Types of Contracts:**
     - **Quantity Contract (MK)** ‚Üí The total quantity of materials is fixed, and release orders are created until the quantity is fulfilled.
     - **Value Contract (WK)** ‚Üí The total contract value is fixed, and release orders can be created until the value is exhausted.

 **2. Scheduling Agreement (T-Code: ME31L)**
   - A **scheduling agreement** is a long-term agreement with a vendor that includes **specific delivery schedules**.
   - Unlike contracts, the delivery dates and quantities are predefined in the system.
   - Scheduling agreements **automatically generate** delivery schedules based on requirements.
   - **Types of Scheduling Agreements:**
     - **Without Release Documentation** ‚Üí The system directly sends the scheduling lines to the vendor.
     - **With Release Documentation** ‚Üí A formal release (forecast or JIT) is required before the vendor proceeds with delivery.

## ‚≠ê SPEICAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS 

SPECIAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS 
Special stock is a stock that do not belong to the company as they are not stored in your company or any other particular location

* Consignment 

* Subcontracing 
* Stock transfer 
* Third party procurement 
* Returnable transport packaging 
* Pipeline handling 
* Sales order stock 
* Project stock 

**CONSIGNMENT STOCK**

Consignment stock is a type of stock where vendor(supplier) keeps all the goods in our location like organization in which we only have to pay for the amount used them.

**STOCK TRANSFER ORDER**

Stock transfer order is used to move materials from one plant to another plant within the same company code



**SUBCONTRACTING STOCK**

In this we have to send the raw materials to the vendor, then vendor used to manufacturing the finished product and send the product to the company 


**STOCK IN TRANSIT**

In SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), Stock in Transit refers to inventory that is being transferred from one location to another within the company, but which has not yet been received at the destination location. It typically arises during inter-plant stock transfers, or when goods are being transferred from a supplier or warehouse to a plant.

**PIPELINE STOCK**

Pipeline Stock refers to the stock that is not physically stored in a company's warehouse but is available for use directly from a vendor or supplier's pipeline, such as gas, water, or electricity.

**PROJECT STOCK**

Project Stock is a special type of stock in SAP used exclusively for a specific project. It ensures that materials are reserved and only used for that particular project, preventing their use in other operations or sales orders.

It is managed as valuated or on valuated project stock 



**RETURNABLE TRANSPORT PACKAGING**

Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP) is a special procurement process where reusable packaging materials, such as pallets, containers, crates, or barrels, are sent along with goods. These packaging materials do not belong to the buyer and must be returned to the vendor after use.

**THIRD PARTY PROCESSING**

Materials are delivered directly to the customer by your vendor, skipping your warehouse. The sales order not processed by the company but by the vendor 

**SALES ORDER STOCK**

Sales Order Stock is a special stock type in SAP that is reserved for a specific sales order. It ensures that the materials procured or produced for a particular customer‚Äôs order are exclusively used to fulfill that order, preventing their use for other purposes.



| **Special Procurement Type** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| **Consignment (K)** | The material is stored at the company's location but remains the vendor‚Äôs property until used. Payment is made only when consumed. |
| **Subcontracting (L)** | Raw materials are sent to a subcontractor, who processes them and delivers the finished product back. |
| **Stock Transfer (U)** | Transfer of material between plants within the same company code or different company codes. |
| **Third-Party Processing (X)** | Material is delivered directly from the vendor to the customer without passing through the company. Used in **drop shipping** scenarios. |
| **Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP) (M)** | The supplier delivers materials in returnable packaging, which is sent back after use. |
| **Pipeline (P)** | Materials such as gas, water, or electricity are supplied through pipelines or cables, with consumption-based invoicing. |
| **By-Product (O)** | A secondary product obtained during the manufacturing of another material. |
| **External Processing (E)** | Part of the manufacturing process is outsourced to an external vendor. |
| **Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI)** | The vendor monitors stock levels and replenishes materials automatically. |

## ‚≠ê SERVICE MASTER 

The Service Master in SAP MM is a central repository that stores details about external services procured by a company, such as consulting, maintenance, repairs, or transportation. Unlike material master, which deals with physical goods, service master records are used to manage non-stock services efficiently.

**Purpose**: The service master record counts as part of the master data within External Services
Management and serves as a source of data for you to draw upon when creating service specifications.
Structure: A service master record contains the following principal information for the unique description
of a service:

* Service number

* Service category

* Descriptive texts (short and long text)

* Base unit of measurement

* Material/service group

* Valuation class

## ‚≠ê PRICING PROCEDURE 

calculation of cost and price mentioned in purchase order based on condition which are mentioned by the suppliers

* Standard type of condition types 

* Gross price 
* Discount 
* Freight / delivery cost
* Surcharges 
* Taxes 
* Insurance 

**Gross price**: price excluding the discounts and subcharges
