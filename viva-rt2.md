‚≠ê **types of procurement** 

* internal 

* external 

---

 **1Ô∏è‚É£ External Procurement**

**External Procurement** involves acquiring goods or services from external vendors or suppliers outside the organization. This is the most common method of procurement and includes the process of sourcing, purchasing, and receiving materials from external sources.

**Key Points in External Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The materials are obtained from third-party vendors or suppliers.
- **Stock Procurement**: The goods are bought and stored in the company's inventory.
- **Consumption-Based Procurement**: The goods are consumed immediately or used directly in production.
- **Subcontracting**: Semi-finished goods are sent to an external supplier for processing, and the finished goods are returned.
- **Third-Party Procurement**: Goods are directly delivered from a vendor to the customer, bypassing the company‚Äôs inventory.

---

 **2Ô∏è‚É£ Internal Procurement**

**Internal Procurement** involves moving goods or materials from one plant, warehouse, or storage location to another within the same organization. This is commonly referred to as **Stock Transfer** or **Inter-Plant Transfer**.

 **Key Points in Internal Procurement**:
- **Source of Supply**: The goods are obtained from the organization's own plants or storage locations, not external suppliers.
- **Stock Transfer**: Material is moved from one location to another within the organization.
- **No Purchase Order**: Since the transaction happens within the same organization, there is no need for a formal purchase order.
- **No Vendor Involvement**: No external vendor is involved in the process.

 **Key Differences Between Internal and External Procurement:**

| Aspect                          | **External Procurement**                                       | **Internal Procurement**                                      |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Source of Supply**             | External vendors/suppliers                                   | Internal plants or storage locations                          |
| **Transaction Involvement**      | Involves a purchase order (PO), vendor, and payment process. | Involves stock transfer between locations, no vendor.          |
| **Materials Movement**           | Materials are received from external suppliers into stock.   | Materials are moved between different plants or storage locations. |
| **Procurement Process**          | Full procurement process (PO, GR, Invoice, Payment).         | Simple stock transfer or consignment process.                 |
| **Example**                      | Buying raw materials or finished goods from an external supplier. | Transferring finished goods from one warehouse to another.    |

---

 **Use Cases:**

 **External Procurement**:
- Used when the organization needs materials or services from outside suppliers, such as raw materials, finished goods, or services like consulting.
  
 **Internal Procurement**:
- Used for internal transfers, where materials need to be moved from one location or plant to another within the same organization (e.g., moving raw materials from warehouse A to production plant B).

### methods for procurements 

1. procurement for stock

2. procurement for direct consumption 

**procurement for stock** 

* Stock Procurement involves purchasing materials from external vendors and storing them in the company‚Äôs inventory or stock. This method is used when the organization wants to maintain control over the materials in stock and keep them available for future use.

key components

* goods receipt

* stock management 
* purchasing order 
* invoice verification 

material must have material master 

**procurement for direct consumoption**

In this method, goods are procured, but they are not stocked‚Äîthey are directly consumed by production or other operations.

* goods receipt 

* no stock update 

* no stock management 

material may have master 

* one time purchase order

* longer terms contract 

* longer terms scheduling agreement

### ‚ö° **RENCONCILIATION**

What is a Reconciliation Account?
A Reconciliation Account in SAP is a General Ledger (G/L) account that connects sub-ledgers (e.g., Vendor Accounts in Accounts Payable) to the main ledger (General Ledger - FI module).

üîπ It ensures that all vendor transactions (purchases, invoices, payments) are automatically posted to the correct G/L accounts in Financial Accounting (FI).

üîπ Vendors do not post directly to G/L accounts; instead, they post to vendor sub-ledgers, which in turn update the reconciliation account in FI.

* ‚úÖ Ensures real-time financial integration between MM & FI.

* ‚úÖ Helps in automatic financial posting for vendor transactions.
* ‚úÖ Eliminates the need for manual entries in the General Ledger.

### ‚ö° PARTNER ROLES 

In SAP MM (Materials Management), Partner Roles are used to define the different roles that an entity (like a vendor or customer) plays in a business process. These roles help determine the relationship between the business partner (e.g., vendor, customer) and the company in various transactions.

| **Partner Role**       | **Description**                                                                |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VN (Vendor)**         | The main partner in procurement; the entity supplying the goods/services.      |
| **WE (Goods Supplier)** | The partner who delivers goods (could be different from the vendor in some cases). |
| **RE (Payee)**          | The partner receiving payments (often the vendor or an agent).                |
| **OA (Ordering Address)**| The partner who receives the order (can be the vendor or a specific department). |
| **IV (Invoice Address)** | The partner who receives invoices related to the transaction.                |
| **GR (Goods Receipt)**  | The partner associated with goods receipt (not always used in every business scenario). |

**CONFIGURATION OF VENDOR MASTER**

* account groups for vendors 

* field selection 
* number assignment 
* levels for vendor data 
* partner roles 

 **1. Different Organization Levels of Vendor Master**

The **Vendor Master** in SAP MM is structured into different levels based on the scope and relevance of the data. The organization levels define where the data will be applicable, ranging from a global level (valid for all company codes) to more specific levels.

The main **organization levels** for vendor master records are:

- **Client Level**: Data at the client level is global and applicable across all company codes. Information such as the **vendor's name** and **address** is maintained at this level.
- **Company Code Level**: Data specific to each company code is maintained at this level. It includes the **vendor‚Äôs bank details**, **payment terms**, and **reconciliation accounts**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Data at this level is relevant to procurement activities and includes **partner functions** like **ordering address**, **invoice address**, and **payment terms**.

---

 **2. Significance of Account Group**

The **Account Group** in the vendor master is a crucial element in SAP MM, and its significance lies in:

- **Defining the Number Range**: The account group determines the **number range** for vendor accounts, allowing automatic assignment of vendor account numbers (either internal or external).
- **Controlling Fields**: The account group controls which fields are required, optional, or suppressed when creating or maintaining a vendor master record. Different account groups allow for different sets of required fields based on business needs.
- **Determining Vendor Type**: It helps in categorizing vendors into groups like **external vendors**, **one-time vendors**, and **internal vendors**. The account group helps configure the behavior of the vendor in terms of financial and procurement processes.

---

 **3. Functionality of Partner Functions**

In SAP MM, **Partner Functions** define the different roles a business partner (like a vendor) can play in a transaction. The main functionality of partner functions includes:

- **Role Assignment**: Each partner (vendor) can be assigned multiple roles like **Ordering Address**, **Invoice Address**, **Payee**, **Goods Supplier**, etc. This ensures that the correct party is associated with each part of the process.
- **Transaction Control**: Partner functions control how transactions are handled, such as whether a vendor is used for ordering goods or receiving payments.
- **Flexibility**: They enable flexibility by allowing different partners to handle different parts of the business process (e.g., one partner can be the supplier, another the invoice address).
  
For example, in a **purchase order (PO)**, the **vendor** plays the role of the **ordering address**, but the **invoice address** could be a different entity, allowing separation of responsibilities.

---
 **4. Reconciliation Account and Uses**

A **Reconciliation Account** is a **general ledger (G/L) account** used to aggregate subledger balances from specific vendors. It ensures that transactions are properly reflected in the general ledger for **accounting purposes**.

#### **Uses of Reconciliation Account**:
- **Automatic Posting**: When vendor transactions (like invoices or payments) are posted in the system, the reconciliation account is automatically updated, making financial reporting and analysis easier.
- **Financial Integration**: It links **Material Management (MM)** to **Financial Accounting (FI)**, ensuring that vendor transactions are reflected correctly in the financial statements.
- **Tracking Vendor Balances**: It provides a summary view of all transactions for a vendor in the financial accounts, and it prevents manual updates to the G/L, which reduces errors.

For example, when a vendor‚Äôs invoice is posted, the **vendor sub-ledger account** is updated, and the **reconciliation account** in the G/L is also updated automatically.

---

 **5. Different Levels of Vendor Master**

There are **three main levels** in the vendor master record:

- **Client Level**: This level holds **general information** about the vendor such as name, address, and communication data. This data is applicable across all company codes and purchasing organizations.
- **Company Code Level**: Information specific to the company code is maintained at this level, including **payment terms**, **bank details**, and **tax information**.
- **Purchasing Organization Level**: Information relevant to procurement activities is maintained at this level, including **partner functions**, **order data**, and **payment terms** specific to purchasing.

---

**6. Is it Possible to Create Both Internal and External Number Ranges for the Same Vendor Account Group?**

Yes, it is possible to configure both **internal and external number ranges** for the **same vendor account group** in SAP. 

- **Internal Number Range**: SAP automatically assigns numbers to vendor accounts when a vendor is created.
- **External Number Range**: The user manually assigns a number to the vendor when creating the vendor master record.

To create both number ranges for the same account group:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `SPRO` ‚Üí **IMG** ‚Üí **Financial Accounting (FI)** ‚Üí **Accounts Payable** ‚Üí **Vendor Accounts** ‚Üí **Define Account Group and Number Range**.
2. Configure **number ranges** for each account group, specifying whether they are **internal** or **external**.

This allows flexibility in managing different types of vendors, especially when dealing with **one-time vendors** or **local/foreign vendors**.

---

 **7. How to Block a Vendor in SAP MM**

Vendors can be blocked at the **vendor master** level to prevent any procurement or payment activities. There are two main types of blocks:

1. **Purchasing Block**: Prevents the vendor from being used in procurement transactions.
2. **Payment Block**: Prevents payments from being made to the vendor.

 **Steps to Block a Vendor**:

1. **Go to T-Code**: `XK02` (Change Vendor) or `MK02` (Change Vendor for Purchasing Organization).
2. Enter the **Vendor Number** and **Company Code**.
3. Navigate to the **Payment Transactions** or **Purchasing Data** tab.
4. Under the **Status** section, set the appropriate block (e.g., **Purchasing Block**, **Payment Block**).
5. **Save** the changes to block the vendor.

By blocking a vendor, you ensure that no further transactions are processed for that vendor until the block is removed.

## ‚≠ê PURCHASE INFO RECORD 


*  Material Master and Vendor Master Record are used to store material specific information and vendor specific details, respectively.

* Whereas purchasing info record contains information about a specific material and a vendor supplying the
material.
* It can be maintained at purchasing organization level or plant specific, as per the business requirements.
*  The ‚ÄúPurchasing Info record‚Äù is used to store the combination a Material and Vendor with the pricing details for
the specific period of time, planned delivery time

## ‚≠ê SOURCE LIST 

* for some of the materials, there is more than one
source of supply. You can manage these supply sources
using source lists to control how the application-related
supply sources are used.

* Source list specifies the possible sources of supply for a
Material over a given period of time. It shows the time
period in which a material may be ordered from a given
vendor or under a certain long-term purchase
agreement.

* In the source list, you specify which source of supply is
valid for a certain period of time.

* You can specify a preferred source as fixed or MRP-
relevant for a certain period in the source list.

* You can mark an undesired source as blocked.

1. Streamlined Vendor Selection

2. Automatic Vendor Assignment
3. Prevention of Expired Vendor Contracts
4. Integration with MRP (Material Requirements Planning)
5. Fixed Vendor Assignment
6. Cost Control & Transparency


-------

1. What is use of source list?


The Source List in SAP MM is used to manage and control the vendors authorized to supply a material for a specific plant. It ensures compliance by allowing procurement only from approved sources, automates vendor selection during Purchase Requisition (PR) and Purchase Order (PO) creation, and integrates with Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to select vendors automatically. Additionally, it helps assign Fixed Vendors, restrict unauthorized purchasing, and prevent expired vendor contracts from being used.

2. Is it possible to maintain multiple sources for a plant within same validity period?

Yes, it is possible to maintain multiple vendors for a material at the same plant within the same validity period. SAP allows multiple vendors with defined priority rankings, and one vendor can be marked as Fixed, meaning all procurement should be directed to them. If no vendor is fixed, SAP will consider all eligible vendors during procurement.



3. What are different ways of creation of source list?

The source list can be created in different ways. Manually, it can be created using T-Code ME01 by entering vendor and material details. Automatically, it can be generated using T-Code ME05, which derives data from existing Purchasing Info Records (PIRs) and contracts. Additionally, source lists can be created via PIR integration or during an MRP run, where SAP selects vendors based on pre-defined procurement rules.

## ‚≠ê QUOTA ARANGEMENT 


Quota Arrangement is a mechanism in SAP MM that helps distribute procurement requirements among multiple vendors based on predefined percentages. It ensures that a company sources materials from different suppliers in a structured and controlled manner.

**KEY FEATURES**

**Key Features of Quota Arrangement**  
1. **Vendor Allocation** ‚Äì Assigns a specific percentage of procurement to each vendor.  
2. **Automatic Vendor Selection** ‚Äì When creating a Purchase Requisition (PR) or Purchase Order (PO), SAP selects the vendor automatically based on quota percentages.  
3. **Quota Splitting** ‚Äì If multiple vendors exist, SAP distributes the total procurement requirement based on the quota percentage.  
4. **Quota Arrangement Usage Period** ‚Äì Defined start and end dates to control the validity of quota allocation.  
5. **Quota Calculation** ‚Äì Based on past procurement quantities and assigned quota percentages.  


**quota arrangement is tool for source administrration**

![demo](./photos/17.png)

* quota with the lowest quota rating represents the valid source 

### ‚ö° QUOTA RATING 

Quota Rating is a calculated value that helps to determine which vendor will be selected first when there are multiple vendors assigned to the same material in the Quota Arrangement. **The vendor with the lowest quota rating will be selected first for fulfilling procurement requirements.**

## ‚≠ê MATERIAL TYPE 

It defines how materials are managed, procured, and processed within the system. Each material type has specific attributes, controls, and functionalities associated with it, such as procurement method, valuation class, and inventory management.

### ‚ö° Document Type in Purchase Order (PO) in SAP MM

In SAP MM, a Document Type in a Purchase Order (PO) defines the purpose, control parameters, and number range for different types of purchase orders. It helps in classifying and managing procurement documents effectively.

**Key Functions of PO Document Types:**

* Controls Number Range: 

* Determines Field Selection: 

* Manages Workflow & Approvals:

## ‚≠ê ACCOUNT ASSIGNMENT 

 **What is Account Assignment in SAP MM?**  
**Account Assignment** in SAP MM is the process of linking a **Purchase Order (PO), Purchase Requisition (PR), or Goods Receipt (GR)** to a **specific cost object** such as a cost center, project, asset, or sales order. It determines how the cost of the purchased material or service is allocated in financial accounting.  

---

 **Why is Account Assignment Required?**  
- It is required when purchasing **non-stock materials or services**, which are not stored in inventory but consumed directly.  
- It ensures proper tracking of expenses and cost allocation in **FI (Financial Accounting) and CO (Controlling) modules**.  

---

**Types of Account Assignment Categories in SAP MM:**  

| **Account Assignment Category** | **Description** | **Example Usage** |
|--------------------------------|----------------|------------------|
| **K (Cost Center)** | Costs are charged to a **Cost Center**. | Office supplies, stationary, utilities. |
| **F (Order)** | Costs are assigned to an **Internal Order**. | Temporary projects, events. |
| **P (Project/WBS Element)** | Costs are assigned to a **Project (WBS Element)**. | Construction, IT projects. |
| **A (Asset)** | Costs are booked to an **Asset** in Asset Accounting. | Machinery, vehicles. |
| **C (Sales Order)** | Costs are linked to a **Sales Order** in SD. | Customer-specific purchases. |
| **M (Material)** | Costs are charged to **Material** stock. | Inventory procurement. |
| **Q (Project Stock)** | Costs are booked to **Project Stock**. | Raw materials for specific projects. |
| **U (Unknown)** | Used when account assignment is **not yet determined**. | Temporary usage. |

 **Where is Account Assignment Used?**  
- **Purchase Requisition (PR)**
- **Purchase Order (PO)**
- **Service Entry Sheets (SES)**
- **Goods Receipts (GR)**
- **Invoice Verification (MIRO)**  





* **When GR is done for the PO item, stock will not increase in the system, but it will be directly consumed against the cost object.**

## ‚≠ê CONDITIONS 

![demo](./photos/22.png)

Conditions used to represents pricing elements like price, discounts, subcharges, taxes, delivery costs

Conditions can be maintained while creating quotations, info record, outline agreement, po

* PB00, PBXX - gross price 

* RA01 - discount 
* FRA1 - freight 


* Gross price ‚Üí price without any discounts, surcharges in account 

* Net price ‚Üí price taking after discounts and surcharges

* Effective price ‚Üí net price after deduction of cash discount 


**1. Time-Independent Conditions**

These conditions don‚Äôt change based on time. The price or discount is fixed, no matter when you make the purchase.

**2. Time-Dependent Conditions**

These conditions change depending on the time, such as special offers or discounts available only for certain periods.

## ‚≠ê OUTLINE AGREEMENT 

Outline agreement 
Outline agreement is a long term agreement with the vendor regarding the procurement of material or services 
Types 

Contract agreement 

Scheduling agreement 

Long term agreement between the purchase organization and vendor for procurement of material or service 

In **SAP MM (Materials Management)**, an **Outline Agreement** is a long-term purchasing arrangement between a company and a vendor. It is used to streamline procurement by pre-defining terms and conditions for future transactions. There are two main types of outline agreements in SAP MM:

 **1. Contract (T-Code: ME31K)**
   - A **contract** is a formal agreement with a vendor that specifies the terms of procurement but does not contain detailed delivery schedules.
   - It defines **quantity-based** or **value-based** agreements.
   - The actual procurement is done using **release orders (Purchase Orders, T-Code: ME21N)** referencing the contract.
   - **Types of Contracts:**
     - **Quantity Contract (MK)** ‚Üí The total quantity of materials is fixed, and release orders are created until the quantity is fulfilled.
     - **Value Contract (WK)** ‚Üí The total contract value is fixed, and release orders can be created until the value is exhausted.

 **2. Scheduling Agreement (T-Code: ME31L)**
   - A **scheduling agreement** is a long-term agreement with a vendor that includes **specific delivery schedules**.
   - Unlike contracts, the delivery dates and quantities are predefined in the system.
   - Scheduling agreements **automatically generate** delivery schedules based on requirements.
   - **Types of Scheduling Agreements:**
     - **Without Release Documentation** ‚Üí The system directly sends the scheduling lines to the vendor.
     - **With Release Documentation** ‚Üí A formal release (forecast or JIT) is required before the vendor proceeds with delivery.

## ‚≠ê SPEICAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS 

SPECIAL PROCUREMENT PROCESS 
Special stock is a stock that do not belong to the company as they are not stored in your company or any other particular location

* Consignment 

* Subcontracing 
* Stock transfer 
* Third party procurement 
* Returnable transport packaging 
* Pipeline handling 
* Sales order stock 
* Project stock 

**CONSIGNMENT STOCK**

Consignment stock is a type of stock where vendor(supplier) keeps all the goods in our location like organization in which we only have to pay for the amount used them.

**STOCK TRANSFER ORDER**

Stock transfer order is used to move materials from one plant to another plant within the same company code



**SUBCONTRACTING STOCK**

In this we have to send the raw materials to the vendor, then vendor used to manufacturing the finished product and send the product to the company 


**STOCK IN TRANSIT**

In SAP Materials Management (SAP MM), Stock in Transit refers to inventory that is being transferred from one location to another within the company, but which has not yet been received at the destination location. It typically arises during inter-plant stock transfers, or when goods are being transferred from a supplier or warehouse to a plant.

**PIPELINE STOCK**

Pipeline Stock refers to the stock that is not physically stored in a company's warehouse but is available for use directly from a vendor or supplier's pipeline, such as gas, water, or electricity.

**PROJECT STOCK**

Project Stock is a special type of stock in SAP used exclusively for a specific project. It ensures that materials are reserved and only used for that particular project, preventing their use in other operations or sales orders.

It is managed as valuated or on valuated project stock 



**RETURNABLE TRANSPORT PACKAGING**

Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP) is a special procurement process where reusable packaging materials, such as pallets, containers, crates, or barrels, are sent along with goods. These packaging materials do not belong to the buyer and must be returned to the vendor after use.

**THIRD PARTY PROCESSING**

Materials are delivered directly to the customer by your vendor, skipping your warehouse. The sales order not processed by the company but by the vendor 

**SALES ORDER STOCK**

Sales Order Stock is a special stock type in SAP that is reserved for a specific sales order. It ensures that the materials procured or produced for a particular customer‚Äôs order are exclusively used to fulfill that order, preventing their use for other purposes.



| **Special Procurement Type** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| **Consignment (K)** | The material is stored at the company's location but remains the vendor‚Äôs property until used. Payment is made only when consumed. |
| **Subcontracting (L)** | Raw materials are sent to a subcontractor, who processes them and delivers the finished product back. |
| **Stock Transfer (U)** | Transfer of material between plants within the same company code or different company codes. |
| **Third-Party Processing (X)** | Material is delivered directly from the vendor to the customer without passing through the company. Used in **drop shipping** scenarios. |
| **Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP) (M)** | The supplier delivers materials in returnable packaging, which is sent back after use. |
| **Pipeline (P)** | Materials such as gas, water, or electricity are supplied through pipelines or cables, with consumption-based invoicing. |
| **By-Product (O)** | A secondary product obtained during the manufacturing of another material. |
| **External Processing (E)** | Part of the manufacturing process is outsourced to an external vendor. |
| **Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI)** | The vendor monitors stock levels and replenishes materials automatically. |

## ‚≠ê SERVICE MASTER 

The Service Master in SAP MM is a central repository that stores details about external services procured by a company, such as consulting, maintenance, repairs, or transportation. Unlike material master, which deals with physical goods, service master records are used to manage non-stock services efficiently.

**Purpose**: The service master record counts as part of the master data within External Services
Management and serves as a source of data for you to draw upon when creating service specifications.
Structure: A service master record contains the following principal information for the unique description
of a service:

* Service number

* Service category

* Descriptive texts (short and long text)

* Base unit of measurement

* Material/service group

* Valuation class

## ‚≠ê PRICING PROCEDURE 

calculation of cost and price mentioned in purchase order based on condition which are mentioned by the suppliers

* Standard type of condition types 

* Gross price 
* Discount 
* Freight / delivery cost
* Surcharges 
* Taxes 
* Insurance 

**Gross price**: price excluding the discounts and subcharges 

**Net price**: price taking discounts, surcharges, taxes

**Effective price**: net price plus delivery cost, cash discounts


A vendor‚Äôs price of a material is made up of different components:

* Gross Price

* Surcharge
* Freight Cost
* Taxes

**PRICE DETERMINATION PROCESS**

* Condition table is created to group together fields for which we want to maintain condition record

* Assign the condition tables to access sequence

* Define condition type and assign access sequence to condition type

* Define pricing procedure in calculation schema

* Define vendor and purchasing Org. schema

* Assign Calculation schema to vendor and purchasing organization schema combination

* Maintain condition records in the condition table

## ‚≠ê INVENTORY MANAGEMENT 

Inventory Management in SAP Material Management (SAP MM) is responsible for managing and tracking materials throughout their lifecycle in a company. It includes goods receipt, goods issue, stock transfers, and physical inventory management.

1. goods receipt 

2. goods issue 

3. stock transfer and stock posting 
4. physical inventory management 
5. reservation 

* It is process for monitoring the flow of goods in and out in the plant, store or warehouse.

* It keeps track of quantity and value of the material.

* Process involves managing of company stock and different special stocks like consignment stocks, pipeline handling, third-party stocks, returnable transport packaging (RTP) stock, sales order stock, project stocks
ete.

* Inventory management is part of material management and is integrated with different modules sales and
distribution, production planning, quality management, warehouse management and finance.

* Multiple documents like goods receipt, goods issue, transfer posting, physical inventory as per the requirement are created

### ‚ö° MATERIAL DOCUMENT 

A Material Document in SAP MM is a record that captures every goods movement, such as Goods Receipt (GR), Goods Issue (GI), or Stock Transfers. It serves as proof of material transactions in inventory and financial accounting.

---

* All transactions that bring about a change in stock are entered in real time, as are the stock updates resulting from these changes.

* For each goods movement a document is created which is used by the system to update quantities and values and serves as proof of goods movements. This document is called the material document.

* We can track the stock levels for any material at any instance in the system. We can see how much stock is lying in the warehouse, on-order, in transit, in quality inspection, blocked etc. and how much stock do we
have under consignment, reservation against WBS or sales order etc.

### ‚ö° MANAGEMENT OF STOCK BY VALUE 

The stocks are managed not only on a quantity basis but also by value. The system automatically updates the
following data each time there is a goods movement:

* Quantity and value for Inventory Management

* Account assignment for cost accounting

* G/L accounts for financial accounting via automatic account assignment

When you enter a goods movement, you must enter the plant and the storage location of the goods. The
system derives the company code from the plant via the valuation area and updates G/L accounts accordingly.

### ‚ö° GOODS MOVEMENT 

* Goods movement is any transaction resulting in change in stock.

* We can post following types of goods movement:

**Goods receipt**

* goods receipt is a goods movement with which the receipt of goods from a vendor or from production is posted.

* goods receipt leads to an increase in warehouse stock.

**Goods Issue**

* A goods issue (Gl) is a goods movement with which a material withdrawal or material issue, a material
consumption, or a shipment of goods to a customer is posted.
*  goods issue leads to a reduction in warehouse stock.

### ‚ö°MOVEMENT TYPE 

Movement type is the three digit identification key of the goods movement. it helps to differentiate the between
various goods movement.

movement type controls many functions:

* Controls quantity update

* Stock and value update for material

* Field selection control for the inventory documents in system

* Determination of g/l account

* Printing gi/gr slips

---

* 1** - gr against reference document

* 2** - GI for consumption

## ‚≠ê GOODS RECEIPT 

A Goods Receipt (GR) is a goods movement with which the receipt of goods from a vendor or from production which is posted. A goods receipt leads to an increase in warehouse stock. All transactions that bring about a

* change in stock are entered real time in SAP R/3

* Stock is updated real time at the time of posting of a goods receipt.

* Goods receipts are processed against the open purchase order quantity.

* The open purchase order quantity is the quantity still to be delivered for an ordered item. It is calculated as the difference between the quantity ordered and the quantity delivered to date.

types 

* planned goods receipt 

* unplanned goods receipt 

---
* 1Ô∏è‚É£ Planned Goods Receipt ‚Äì GR against a reference document (e.g., Purchase Order, Production Order).

* 2Ô∏è‚É£ Unplanned Goods Receipt ‚Äì GR without a reference document (e.g., Direct Stock Entry, Free-of-Charge Deliveries).

**PLANNED GOODS RECEIPT**

* planned goods receipt used purchase orders, production order, reservation 


**GOODS RECEIPT WITH REFERENCE TO PURCHASE ORDER**

**EFFECTS**

* Material document is created

* Accounting document is created if the goods movement is relevant for Accounting.
* Stock & Consumption A/c updated

* Stock and value updated in material master

* PO /PO history update

* Inspection lot is created for QM relevant materials.

---

## ‚≠ê STOCK TYPES 

* UNRESTRICTRED STOCK 

* QUALITY INSPECTION STOCK 

* BLCKED STOCK 


goods receipt can be done 1 step and 2 step 

In the case of 1-step process, materials are directly taken into stock or posted to consumption based
upon the nature of purchase order. Goods receipt is posted with Movement type 101.

In the case of 2-step process, materials are taken to GR blocked stock and are subsequently taken to stock. Goods receipt is done using movement types 103 + 105 if the materials are to be posted to non-valuated GR blocked stock and subsequently posted to warehouse stock.

**REFERENCE DOCUMENT FOR GOODS RECEIPT**

* purchase order 

* production order 

* reservation 
* inbound delivery 
* outbound delivery 

---
**Accounting entry for stock material**
* Stock account - Material (BSX): Debit

* GRI/IR clearing - Material (WRX): Credit

**Accounting entry for account assigned PO**
* Consumption account/Asset account: Debit

* GRI/IR clearing‚ÄîMaterial (WRX): Credit

**Goods Movement**: A physical or logical movement of materials leading to a change in stock levels
or resulting in the consumption of the material.

**Goods Issue**: A reduction in warehouse stock due to a withdrawal of stock or the delivery of goods
to a customer.

**Movement Type**: The movement type in SAP R/3 system is a three digit key used to differentiate between goods movements. Examples of such goods movements are goods receipts, goods issues, or transfer posting.

* Goods Issue (Gl) is a type of goods movement with which the materials are issued from the
warehouse.

* Goods Issue leads to a decrease in warehouse stock.

+ Stock is updated real time at the time of posting of goods Issue.

+ Accounting document is created if the goods movement is relevant for accounting.


### ‚ö° GOODS ISSUE 

Goods Issue (GI) in SAP MM (Materials Management) is the process of removing stock from inventory for consumption, delivery, or transfer. It decreases the stock quantity and affects the financial accounting (FI) and inventory management (IM).

* planned goods issue 

* unplanned goods issue 
* goods issue with reference 
* goods issue without reference 

![demo](./photos/30.png)

A goods issue has the following results in the system:
+ Material document is created

+ Accounting document is created (if the goods movement is relevant for accounting)
+ Goods receipt/issue slip is created
+ Stock update
+ Update of G/L accounts
+ Consumption update
+ Reservation update
+ Order update
+ Transfer requirement is created when the Warehouse Management System is connected
+ Inspection lot is created when QM is connected

## ‚≠ê STOCK TRANSFER 

A transfer posting usually refers to a change in a material's stock (for example, release from quality  inspection, accepting consignment material). In a transfer posting, the material can remain in its original
storage bin or be transferred.


Stock transfers can occur either within one plant or between two plants or company codes. 

Stock transfers and transfer postings are used to represent organizational-relevant transfers within the company (for example, decentralized storage). 

![demo](./photos/31.png)

Stock transfers can occur at three different levels:
+ Stock transfer from company code to company code

+ Stock transfer from plant to plant
+ Stock transfer from storage location to storage location (in the plant)

---

## ‚≠ê PIPELINE MATERIAL 

* material type - PIPE

Depending on the system configuration, a material can be withdrawn only from the pipeline or, in addition to
the pipeline, normal stocks of the material can also be managed.

Materials with Material Type PIPE:
+ Pipeline handling is mandatory for materials with material type PIPE

+ They are neither procured nor planned. They can be withdrawn from the pipeline at any time and in
any quantity.
+ They are not stored or kept in stock. No physical inventory is taken.
+ Pipeline movements are mandatory in all valuation areas; i.e. no other goods movements may be posted.

Other Material Types:
For each material type, you can specify in the valuation area whether pipeline movements are:
+ Mandatory

+ Allowed

If pipeline movements are not mandatory but allowed, the material can be kept in stock and both pipeline and other movements can be posted.

A material of this type can be withdrawn from your company‚Äôs own stock, from consignment stock, or from
the pipeline.

### ‚ö°Third-Party Processing

+ In third-party processing, you place a purchase order with a vendor to deliver goods or perform a service
for a customer (third party).

+ This means that your company forward the order to an external vendor who then sends the material
directly to the customer and invoices you.


* entering a sales order 

* entering purchase order to vendor 
* delivery goods to customer 
* entering a vendor invoice 
* creating a billing document for the customer

| **Special Procurement Type**    | **Special Stock Indicator** |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Consignment**                  | **K**                       |
| **Subcontracting**               | **L**                       |
| **Third-Party Procurement**      | **S**                       |
| **Stock Transfer (Intra-Company)**| **T**                       |
| **Pipeline**                     | **P**                       |
| **Project Stock**                | **Q**                       |
| **Returnable Transport Packaging (RTP)** | **N**                 |
| **Sales Order Stock**            | **E**                       |


The transfer of stock using a stock transport order has the following advantages over the transfer of stock
without a stock transport order:
+ A goods receipt can be planned in the receiving plant.

+ You can enter a vendor (freight vendor) in the stock transport order.
+ Delivery costs can be entered in the stock transport order.
+ The stock transfer order is part of MRP: Purchase requisitions that were created in MRP can be
converted into stock transport orders.
+ The goods issue (Gl) can be entered using a delivery via Shipping (LE-SHP). For the goods issue in
SD, a replenishment delivery is created.
+ The goods receipt (GR) can be posted directly to consumption.
+ The entire process can be monitored via the purchase order history.

## ‚≠ê PHYSICAL INVENTORY 

**Preparation**: In this step the physical inventory document is created, materials are blocked for posting and
the printout of the physical inventory document is distributed.

**Count of Inventory**: In this step, the inventory is counted and updated in the hardcopy of physical
inventory document and then transferred to the system

**Inventory check**: In this step, the difference between the actual and system count is checked and if the difference is acceptable then it is posted which corrects the stock in the system. This changes the quantity
and value of the stocks.

**TYPES**

* continous 

* cyclic 
* periodic 
* sampling 


### **Types of Physical Inventory in SAP MM**  

Physical Inventory in SAP MM is conducted to ensure that the **actual stock** in the warehouse matches the **stock recorded in the system**. SAP MM supports multiple types of physical inventory processes based on business needs.

---

 **1Ô∏è‚É£ Periodic Physical Inventory**  
üìå **Definition:**  
- Conducted **once a year** (or at a fixed interval).  
- All materials are counted at the same time, usually at the end of the fiscal year.  

üìå **Use Case:**  
- Suitable for companies that need an **annual stock audit**.  
- Common in industries with **low stock fluctuation** (e.g., manufacturing).  

üìå **SAP Process:**  
- **Create Physical Inventory Document (MI01).**  
- **Enter Counted Stock (MI04).**  
- **Post Differences (MI07).**  

üìå **Pros:**  
‚úÖ Ensures **all stock is counted**.  
‚úÖ Helps in **financial audits**.  

üìå **Cons:**  
‚ùå **Time-consuming** (entire warehouse is counted at once).  
‚ùå **Operations may be disrupted** during stock counting.  

---

 **2Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous (Perpetual) Physical Inventory**  
üìå **Definition:**  
- Inventory is counted **throughout the year**, instead of all at once.  
- Stock for **different materials** is counted on different days.  

üìå **Use Case:**  
- Ideal for **large warehouses** with high stock turnover.  
- Used in **retail** and **e-commerce** industries.  

üìå **SAP Process:**  
- **Assign materials to a continuous inventory cycle.**  
- **Count stock on scheduled dates.**  
- **Update differences in SAP regularly.**  

üìå **Pros:**  
‚úÖ No need to **shut down operations** for stock counting.  
‚úÖ Reduces **errors** by ensuring stock is **constantly updated**.  

üìå **Cons:**  
‚ùå Requires **proper scheduling** and monitoring.  
‚ùå **Difficult to manage** if there are **thousands of materials**.  

---

 **3Ô∏è‚É£ Cycle Counting Physical Inventory**  
üìå **Definition:**  
- Specific materials are counted **at different intervals** based on their importance and movement.  
- **High-value or frequently used materials** are counted **more often**, while **low-value materials** are counted **less frequently**.  

üìå **Use Case:**  
- Suitable for warehouses using the **ABC analysis** method:  
  - **A-items:** High-value, counted monthly.  
  - **B-items:** Medium-value, counted quarterly.  
  - **C-items:** Low-value, counted yearly.  

üìå **SAP Process:**  
- **Define Cycle Counting Indicators in SAP.**  
- **Schedule counts based on priority.**  
- **Perform inventory counts and post differences.**  

üìå **Pros:**  
‚úÖ Reduces **workload** by spreading inventory checks over time.  
‚úÖ Focuses on **critical materials** for better stock accuracy.  

üìå **Cons:**  
‚ùå Requires **proper classification of materials**.  
‚ùå Not suitable if **all materials need to be counted at once**.  

---

 **4Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Sampling (Statistical Inventory)**  
üìå **Definition:**  
- Instead of counting **all materials**, only a **random sample** of materials is counted.  
- If the sample is **accurate**, the system assumes **all stock is correct**.  
- If **errors are found**, more counting is required.  

üìå **Use Case:**  
- Used in **large organizations** where full inventory checks are too costly.  
- Common in **automotive, pharmaceuticals, and high-volume industries**.  

üìå **SAP Process:**  
- **Define Sampling Rules.**  
- **Select random materials for counting.**  
- **Verify stock differences and approve results.**  

üìå **Pros:**  
‚úÖ Saves **time and cost** by avoiding full stock counts.  
‚úÖ Ideal for **huge warehouses** with millions of materials.  

üìå **Cons:**  
‚ùå Risk of **errors** if the sample does not represent the actual stock.  
‚ùå Not suitable for **critical materials** that require full counting.

**POSTING BLOCK**

A Posting Block in SAP MM is a temporary restriction applied during the Physical Inventory process to prevent stock movements (goods issues and receipts) for materials under inventory counting. This ensures that the system stock remains accurate while the counting process is completed.

**FREEZE BOOK OF INVENTORY**

Freezing Book Inventory means capturing the system stock (book inventory) at a specific point in time during physical inventory counting. This prevents the system from updating stock levels while the physical counting is in progress, ensuring accuracy.


Document header 
+ Change planned count date

+ Set or remove Posting block 

+ Freeze book inventory balance 

+ Change physical inventory number
Item level for material not counted 
+ Change stock type

+ Change count unit of measure 

+ Set deletion indicator

* Enter new items provided no count has take place.

*  Delete the document 

physical inventory 

* MI01

* MI04, MI05

* MI07 

* MI20
* mi21

![demo](./photos/33.png)

### ‚ö°CYCLE COUNTING 

* Cycle counting method of physical inventory is a procedure where the materials are counted at regular intervals in a fiscal year.

* The intervals/cycles are based on the cycle counting indicator set for each material.

* Cycle counting indicator is set based on the usage of material.

* This procedure ensures that fast moving materials are verified more frequently where discrepancies are more likely to occur than slow moving materials.

## ‚≠ê BATCH MANAGEMENT 

Batch Management in SAP MM (Materials Management) is used to manage materials that are produced or handled in batches. It allows organizations to track and manage materials based on specific characteristics or properties associated with each batch. Batches can be used to track product quality, expiration dates, or other specific attributes.

* Pharmaceuticals

* Food and Beverages
* Chemicals
* Cosmetics

**STEPS**

MM01 

plant data 1 --> batch management ‚úÖ


You can use the function Create Material or Change material to define the class in the material master record
(classification data).

This class is valid for all batches of the material.

We can also enter the class directly when classifying the first batch.

Depending on how the system is configured, the class is assigned to one of the class types below:
+ 022 for batches at plant level

+ 023 for batches at material level/client level

![demo](./photos/34.png)

## ‚≠ê INVOICE VERIFICATION 

Invoice verification is a procedure which is the last step in material procurement where invoice from vendor is entered in the
system and information is passed on to finance application for vendor payment.
Invoice is a legal document which contains item, item description, freight, discounts, taxes etc.
Purchase department verifies the content in vendor invoice with preceding documents like po, goods receipt and posts the
invoice.

Invoice posting updates po history and also if applicable the valuation price in material master record.

Invoice posting creates a mm invoice document and a fi invoice document.

We can have the gr based invoice verification ticked on the po or it can be blank.

If gr based iv is ticked:

- System will compare the data between PO, GR and invoice document.

- Posting of the gr document is mandatory before we can post the invoice.

If gr based iv is not ticked:

- System will compare the po document and the invoice document.

- Invoice document can be posted before the gr is posted.


**Standard Price:**

In case of materials valuated with standard price, the system posts the difference in PO or Invoice price with
Material master price to price difference account.

This results in no change to the value and price of the material.

**Moving Average Price**:

Materials valuated with moving average price, the price change happens with the cost at which it is delivered.
If there is a variance in PO price or Invoice price then the system posts this difference to stock account and
value and price of the material changes.

### ‚ö° PURCHASE ORDER BASED INVOICE VERIFICATION 

Purchase Order (PO)-Based Invoice Verification is a process in SAP MM (Materials Management) that ensures vendor invoices are checked against the corresponding Purchase Order (PO) and Goods Receipt (GR) before payment is made. This helps maintain accuracy and prevents overpayments or fraud.

**Purchase Order (PO) Creation:**

The buyer creates a PO for materials/services with price, quantity, and terms.

**Goods Receipt (GR) Posting:**

When materials are received, a GR is created, updating stock and generating an accounting entry.

**Invoice Receipt (IR):**

The vendor sends an invoice for the delivered materials/services.

The finance team processes vendor payments via F110 (Automatic Payment Run) or manual payments.

## ‚≠ê BLANKET PURCHASE ORDER 

A purchase order with a validity period and limits for the simplified procurement of materials or services.

A longer-term blanket purchase order enables you to procure different materials or services from a vendor
up to a specified maximum value.

The nature of the materials or services is such that the cost and administrative effort involved in processing
individual purchase orders are too high in relation to their value.

materials or services.

Blanket purchase orders have the item category B and document type FO.
